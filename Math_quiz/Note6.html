        <h3>Question 1:</h3>
        <p>What is the value of π (pi) to two decimal places?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> π (pi) is approximately 3.14.</p>
        <h3>Question 2:</h3>
        <p>If a triangle has angles of 30°, 60°, and 90°, what type of triangle is it?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The triangle is a right-angled triangle. The angles 30°, 60°, and 90° are characteristic of a right triangle.</p><h3>
            Question 3:</h3>
        <p>What is the value of the square root of 121?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The square root of 121 is 11, as 11 multiplied by itself equals 121.</p><h3
        >Question 4:</h3>
        <p>In an arithmetic progression, if a = 3 and d = 4, what is the seventh term?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> In an arithmetic progression, the nth term (aₙ) can be calculated using the formula aₙ = a + (n − 1) d. Substituting a = 3, d = 4, and n = 7, we get aₙ = 3 + (7 − 1) × 4 = 3 + 24 = 27.</p><h3>
            Question 5:</h3>
        <p>What is the result of 2<sup>5</sup>(2 raised to the power of 5)?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> 2<sup>5</sup> is equal to 32. This is obtained by multiplying 2 by itself five times.</p><h3>
            Question 6:</h3>
        <p>If log<sub>2</sub>(x)=3, what is the value of  x?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong>log<sub>2</sub> (x) = 3, means that 2<sup>3</sup> = x. Therefore, x = 8.</p><h3>
            Question 7:</h3>
        <p>What is the area of a rectangle with length 8 units and width 5 units?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The area (A) of a rectangle is calculated as A= length X width. In this case, A= 8 X 5 = 40 square units.</p><h3>
            Question 8:</h3>
        <p>If sin(45°)=cos(45°), what is the value of tan(45°)?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> tan(45°) is equal to 1. This is derived from the trigonometric identity tan(θ) = cos(θ)/sin(θ), and since sin(45°) = cos(45°), tan(45°) = 1/1 = 1.</p><h3>
            Question 9:</h3>
        <p>What is the factorial of 6 (6!)?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720.</p><h3>
            Question 10:</h3>
        <p>In a right-angled triangle, if the legs are 5 units and 12 units, what is the length of the hypotenuse?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The length of the hypotenuse (c) in a right-angled triangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: c = √( a<sub>2</sub> + b<sub>2</sub> ). Substituting a = 5 and b = 12, we get c = √( 5<sup>2</sup> + 12<sup>2</sup> ) = √( 25 + 144 ) = √169 = 13.</p><h3>
            Question 11:</h3>
        <p>What is the perimeter of a square with sides of length 8 units?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The perimeter (P) of a square is calculated as P=4 × side length. In this case, P = 4 × 8 = 32 units.</p><h3>
            Question 12:</h3>
        <p>Calculate the area of a circle with a radius of 5 units. (Use π ≈ 3.14)</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The area (A) of a circle is given by the formula A = πr2. Substituting r = 5 and π ≈ 3.14, we get A ≈ 3.14 × 52 = 3.14 × 25 ≈ 78.5 square units.</p><h3>
            Question 13:</h3>
        <p>Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 13.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve for x, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: 2x + 5 − 5 = 13 − 5. Simplifying, 2x = 8. Divide both sides by 2: x = 4.</p><h3>
            Question 14:</h3>
        <p>What is the sum of the angles in a triangle?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.</p><h3>
            Question 15:</h3>
        <p>If log₃ (9) = x, what is the value of x?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong>log<sub>3</sub> (9) = x means that 3<sup>x</sup> = 9. Therefore, x = 2.</p><h3>
            Question 16:</h3>
        <p>Find the value of sin (60 degrees).</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> sin (60°) = √ 3 / 2 or approximately 0.866.</p><h3>
            Question 17:</h3>
        <p>Calculate the factorial of 7 (7!).</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong>7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 50.</p><h3>
            Question 18:</h3>
        <p>What is the next term in the arithmetic sequence: 5, 9, 13, 17, ...?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The common difference in this arithmetic sequence is 4. Adding 4 to the last term (17), the next term is 21.</p><h3>
            Question 19:</h3>
        <p>Determine the square root of 144.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong>The square root of 144 is 12, as 12 × 12 = 144.</p><h3>
            Question 20:</h3>
        <p>In a right-angled triangle, if one angle is 45 degrees, what is the measure of the other acute angle?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The measure of the other acute angle in a right-angled triangle is 45 degrees.</p>
