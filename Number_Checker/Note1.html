      <h2 style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;"> Prime Numbers </h2>
      <p style="padding: 15px 0;" align="justify">Prime numbers are natural numbers that are divisible by only 1 and the number itself. In other words, prime numbers are positive integers greater than 1 with exactly two factors, 1 and the number itself.
      <br><br>Always remember that 1 is neither prime nor composite. Also, we can say that except for 1, the remaining numbers are classified as prime and composite numbers. All prime numbers are odd numbers except 2, 2 is the smallest prime number and is the only even prime number.</p>
      <br>
      <h3 >Example:</h3>
      <p align="justify">There are 25 prime numbers between 1 and 100, i.e., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.</p><br>
      <h3>Interesting Facts:</h3>
      <p class="interesting-facts">
        1. Euclid's proof (around 300 BC) showed that there are infinitely many prime numbers.
        <br>2. The largest known prime number has over 24 million digits!
        <br>3. Prime numbers play a crucial role in cryptography, ensuring secure communication.

      <h2 style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;"> Palindrome Numbers </h2>
      <p style="padding: 15px 0;" align="justify">Palindrome numbers are like mathematical palindromes. They read the same backward as forward. A number that remains same even if its digits are reversed, is called a palindromic number.</p>
      <br>
      <h3 style="text-align: left;">Example:</h3>
      <p align="justify">Some examples of palindrome numbers include 121, 1331, 1221, 12321, etc.</p><br>
      <h3>Interesting Facts:</h3>
       <p class="interesting-facts">
        1. Palindromic primes are rare but fascinating. The largest known one has 10^1828457-1 digits!
        <br>2. Palindromic numbers have cultural significance and are often considered lucky.
        <br>3. Palindrome dates, like 02/02/2020, are considered special and are celebrated by some.

      <h2 style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;"> Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) </h2>
      <p style="padding: 15px 0;" align="justify">The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two or more numbers is the greatest common factor number that divides them, exactly. The GCD plays a vital role in number theory and cryptography.<br>
       <br>  Euclid's algorithm, used to find the GCD, is one of the oldest algorithms still in common use today!
        <br><br>If a and b are two numbers then the greatest common divisor of both the numbers is denoted by gcd(a, b). To find the gcd of numbers, we need to list all the factors of the numbers and find the largest common factor. </p>
      <br>
      <h3 >Example:</h3>
      <p style="padding: 0;" align="justify">For example, the GCD of 12 and 18 is 6, as 6 is the largest number that divides both 12 and 18 without leaving a remainder.</p><br>
      <h3>Interesting Facts:</h3>
       <p class="interesting-facts">
        1. The GCD is also known as the greatest common factor (GCF) or highest common factor (HCF).
        <br>2. The Extended Euclidean Algorithm is an extension of Euclid's algorithm used for solving Diophantine equations.
        <br>3. The GCD has applications in reducing fractions to their simplest form and solving linear Diophantine equations.
