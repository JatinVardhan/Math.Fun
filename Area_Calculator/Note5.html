      <h2 style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;"> CIRCLE </h2>
      <p style="padding: 15px 0;" align="justify">A circle is a round-shaped figure that has no corners or edges. In geometry, a circle can be defined as a closed shape, two-dimensional shape, curved shape.</p>
      <br>
      <h3> Area and Circumference of a Circle </h3>
      <p style="padding: 15px 0;" align="justify">The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr², where "r" is the radius of the circle. 
        <br>The circumference (perimeter) of a circle is given by C = 2πr.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <p align="justify">If a circle has a radius of 5 units, the area is A = π(5)² = 25π square units, and the circumference is C = 2π(5) = 10π units.</p><br>
    </div>

    <div class="box1">
      <h2 style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;"> TRIANGLE </h2>
      <p style="padding: 15px 0;" align="justify">In Geometry, a triangle is a three-sided polygon that consists of three edges and three vertices. The most important property of a triangle is that the sum of the internal angles of a triangle is equal to 180 degrees. This property is called angle sum property of triangle. 
      <br><br>If ABC is a triangle, then it is denoted as ∆ABC, where A, B and C are the vertices of the triangle. A triangle is a two-dimensional shape, in Euclidean geometry, which is seen as three non-collinear points in a unique plane. </p>
      <br>
      <h3 > Area and Perimeter of a Triangle </h3>
      <p style="padding: 15px 0;" align="justify">The area of a triangle is given by the formula A = ½bh, where "b" is the base and "h" is the height.
        <br> The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of its three sides.</p>
      <br>
      <h3 style="text-align: left;">Example:</h3>
      <p align="justify">For a triangle with a base of 8 units and a height of 6 units, the area is A = ½(8)(6) = 24 square units, and the perimeter is the sum of its sides.</p><br>
    </div>

    <div class="box1">
      <h2 style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;"> SQUARE </h2>
      <p style="padding: 15px 0;" align="justify">In Geometry, a square is a two-dimensional plane figure with four equal sides and all the four angles are equal to 90 degrees.
      <br><br>The properties of rectangle are somewhat similar to a square, but the difference between the two is, a rectangle has only its opposite sides equal. Therefore, a rectangle is called a square only if all its four sides are of equal length.</p>
      <br>
      <h3 > Area and Perimeter of a Square </h3>
      <p style="padding: 15px 0;" align="justify">The area of a square is given by the formula A = side², where "side" is the length of one of its sides. <br>The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all four sides.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <p align="justify">If a square has a side length of 4 units, the area is A = 4² = 16 square units, and the perimeter is P = 4(side) = 16 units.</p><br>
    </div>

    <div class="box1">
      <h2 style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;"> RECTANGLE </h2>
      <p style="padding: 15px 0;" align="justify">PA Rectangle is a four sided-polygon, having all the internal angles equal to 90 degrees. The two sides at each corner or vertex, meet at right angles. The opposite sides of the rectangle are equal in length which makes it different from a square.</p>
      <br>
      <h3 > Area and Perimeter of a Rectangle </h3>
      <p style="padding: 15px 0;" align="justify">The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = length × width.
        <br> The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all four sides.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <p align="justify">For a rectangle with a length of 10 units and a width of 6 units, the area is A = 10 × 6 = 60 square units, and the perimeter is P = 2(length + width) = 32 units.</p><br>
