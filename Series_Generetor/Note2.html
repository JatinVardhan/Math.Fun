      <h2 style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;">  Factors </h2>
      <p style="padding: 15px 0;" align="justify">Factors are the building blocks of any number. Every positive integer can be expressed as a product of prime numbers, and these prime numbers are its prime factors.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <p align="justify">The prime factorization of 24 is 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 or 2^3 x 3, where 2 and 3 are prime numbers.</p><br>
      <h3>Interesting Facts:</h3>
      <p class="interesting-facts">
        1. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every positive integer has a unique prime factorization.
        <br>2. Prime factorization is crucial in number theory and cryptography.
        <br>3. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit.

      <h2 style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;"> Fibonacci Series </h2>
      <p style="padding: 15px 0;" align="justify">The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. It has widespread applications in mathematics and nature.</p>
      <br>
      <h3 style="text-align: left;">Example:</h3>
      <p align="justify">The Fibonacci series starts: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on. Each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.</p><br>
      <h3>Interesting Facts:</h3>
      <p class="interesting-facts">
        1. Fibonacci numbers appear in various natural phenomena, such as the arrangement of leaves on a stem or the spiral of a nautilus shell.
        <br>2. The ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers converges to the golden ratio, approximately 1.618.
        <br>3. Fibonacci numbers are used in algorithms for searching and sorting.

      <h2 style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;"> Arithmetic Progression (AP) Series </h2>
      <p style="padding: 15px 0;" align="justify">Arithmetic Progression (AP) is a sequence of numbers in which the difference of any two successive members is a constant. This constant difference is known as the "common difference."</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <p align="justify">In the AP series 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, the common difference is 3. Each term is obtained by adding 3 to the previous term.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Interesting Facts:</h3>
      <p class="interesting-facts" >
        1. The general form of an AP series is given by a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, and so on.
        <br>2. AP series is widely used in mathematics, physics, and finance.
        <br>3. The sum of the first n terms of an AP series can be calculated using specific formulas.
        <br>
        <pre>            
                 i.e.  Sn = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d]

            where 
            n represents the number of terms of AP
            a is the first term of the AP
            d is the common difference of AP</pre>

    <h2 style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;"> GP Series (Geometric Progression) </h2>
      <pstyle="padding: 15px 0;" align="justify">Geometric Progression (GP) is a sequence of numbers in which the ratio of any two successive members is a constant. This constant ratio is known as the "common ratio."</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <p align="justify">In the GP series 2, 6, 18, 54, 162, the common ratio is 3. Each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 3.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Interesting Facts:</h3>
      <p class="interesting-facts">
        1. The general form of a GP series is given by a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, and so on.
        <br>2. GP series is used in various fields, including physics, biology, and finance.
        <br>3. The sum of the first n terms of a GP series can be calculated using specific formulas.
        <pre>
           The sum of a GP is the sum of a few or all terms of a geometric progression. GP sum is calculated by one of the following formulas:

            Sum of n terms of GP, Sn = a(1 - rn) / (1 - r), when r â‰  1
            Sum of infinite terms of GP, Sn = a / (1 - r), when |r| < 1

            Here, 'a' is the first term and 'r' is the common ratio of GP.
