    <div class="box1">
      <h2 style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;"> Basic Arithmetic Operations </h2>
      <p style="padding: 15px 0;" align="justify">Basic arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations are fundamental in mathematics and form the basis for more complex mathematical concepts.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <p align="justify">For example, the sum of 5 and 3 is 8, the difference between 7 and 4 is 3, the product of 2 and 6 is 12, and the quotient of 9 divided by 3 is 3.</p><br>
      <h3>Interesting Facts:</h3>
      <p class="interesting-facts">
        1. The basic operations are the foundation for solving mathematical problems and real-world applications.
        <br>2. The order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, dictates the sequence in which operations should be performed.
        <br>3. Arithmetic operations are used extensively in computer programming and scientific calculations.
      </p>

    <div class="box1">
      <h2 style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;"> BODMAS </h2>
      <p style="padding: 15px 0;" align="justify">BODMAS is an acronym that represents the order of operations in mathematics: Brackets, Orders (i.e., powers and square roots, etc.), Division and Multiplication (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).</p>
      <br>
      <h3 style="text-align: left;">Example:</h3>
      <p align="justify">To evaluate an expression like 3 + 5 × 2, BODMAS guides us to perform the multiplication first and then the addition, resulting in 13.</p><br>
      <h3>Interesting Facts:</h3>
      <p class="interesting-facts">
        1. BODMAS ensures a standardized way of solving mathematical expressions to avoid ambiguity.
        <br>2. Following BODMAS is crucial to obtaining accurate and consistent results in calculations.
        <br>3. BODMAS is a fundamental concept taught in mathematics education worldwide.

    <div class="box1">
      <h2 style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;"> Square & Square Root </h2>
      <p style="padding: 15px 0;" align="justify">The square of a number is the result of multiplying the number with itself. 
       <br> <br>Square root of a number is a value, which on multiplication by itself, gives the original number. The square root is an inverse method of squaring a number. Hence, squares and square roots are related concepts.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <p align="justify">The square of 4 is 4 × 4 = 16, and the square root of 16 is 4.</p><br>
      <h3>Interesting Facts:</h3>
      <p class="interesting-facts">
        1. Perfect squares are numbers that have integer square roots.
        <br>2. The square root of 2 is an irrational number, meaning it cannot be expressed as a fraction.
        <br>3. Squaring and square roots are fundamental in geometry, physics, and engineering.
      </p>

    <div class="box1">
      <h2 style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;"> Exponent & Modulo </h2>
      <p style="padding: 15px 0;" align="justify">In mathematics, power defines a base number raised to the exponent, where base number is the factor which is multiplied by itself and exponent denotes the number of times the same base number is multiplied.<br>
        <br> Modulo is the remainder when one number is divided by another.</p>
      <br>
      <h3 style="text-align: left;">Example:</h3>
      <p align="justify">In the expression 2^3, 2 is raised to the power of 3, resulting in 2 × 2 × 2 = 8. The modulo of 7 divided by 3 is 1, as 7 = 3 × 2 + 1.</p><br>
      <h3>Interesting Facts:</h3>
      <p class="interesting-facts">
        1. Exponents are used in scientific notation, where numbers are expressed as a product of a coefficient and a power of 10.
        <br>2. Modulo has applications in computer science, cryptography, and number theory.
        <br>3. Exponents and modulo are essential concepts in algebra and discrete mathematics.
      </p>

    <div class="box1">
      <h2 style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;"> Logarithm & Factorial </h2>
      <p style="padding: 15px 0;" align="justify">Logarithms measure the exponent to which a base must be raised to obtain a certain number. Factorial is the product of all positive integers up to a given number.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <p align="justify">The logarithm of 100 to the base 10 is 2, as 10^2 = 100. The factorial of 5 is 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.</p><br>
      <h3>Interesting Facts:</h3>
      <p class="interesting-facts">
        1. Logarithms are useful for solving exponential equations and are common in fields like physics and engineering.
        <br>2. Factorials are used in combinatorics and probability theory.
        <br>3. Both logarithms and factorials have applications in algorithms and computer science.

    <div class="box1">
      <h2 style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;"> Trigonometry Functions </h2>
      <p style="padding: 15px 0;" align="justify">Trigonometry is the branch of mathematics that studies the relationships between the angles and sides of triangles. Common trigonometric functions include sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant, and cotangent.</p>
      <br>
      <h3 style="text-align: left;">Example:</h3>
      <p align="justify">In a right-angled triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the hypotenuse.</p><br>
      <h3>Interesting Facts:</h3>
      <p class="interesting-facts">
        1. Trigonometry is widely used in physics, engineering, and computer graphics.
        <br>2. The unit circle is a fundamental concept in trigonometry.
        <br>3. Trigonometric functions have applications in modeling periodic phenomena.
